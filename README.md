# MiSK FEWD3 Course Repository
Welcome to Front-End Web Development (FEWD) at General Assembly! This is where we will be hosting all class slides, assignments, starter code, and more.

## Communication
General Assembly's gives every class its own Slack chatroom - here is ours: [MiSK FEWD 3 Slack Channel](https://miskacademy.slack.com/messages/CKEMBL43T/team/UDSMSV54J/). It's the best way to get ahold of your instructors. You should have received an invitation but if not, let Marc know and we can get you in there.

Slack is channel based; if you have questions that would benefit everyone, ask them in the *#general* channel. Missing class? Of course not, but give us a heads up in *#missing-class*. We'll also post useful resources in *#useful-resources*. You can also contact instructors, TAs and classmates directly using the tool.

## Tools and Resources
During this course, there are a number of tools you will be expected to have and others we think you'll want to have. Have a look:

### Required Tools
* [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads) - Desktop application for our class chatroom (**please disable audio notifications!**).
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) - Text editor with syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - Desktop application for Github.
* [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) - Default browser for the class.

### Recommended Tools
* [Codepen](https://codepen.io) - Do front-end development in the browser! We'll also be showing you many live examples in Codepen so it would be good to at least familiarize yourself with it if you don't plan on signing up.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My favorite text editor at the moment, really good for front-end dev.
* [Dashlane](https://dashlane.com) - My favorite password management tool. Get used to saving passwords if you want to be a professional front-end dev.
* [Trello](https://trello.com) - The best task management tool on the internet. This would be a great way for you to organize your final project.
